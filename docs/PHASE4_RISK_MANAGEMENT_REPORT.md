   - Circuit breakers (daily loss, drawdown, position limits)
   - Real-time risk monitoring and reporting
   - Volatility-based adjustments

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Kelly Criterion Position Sizing

```python
def calculate_kelly_position_size(self, win_rate: float, avg_win: float, 
                                avg_loss: float, current_price: float) -> float:
    # Kelly formula: f = (bp - q) / b
    b = avg_win / avg_loss
    p = win_rate
    q = 1 - win_rate
    
    kelly_fraction = (b * p - q) / b
    
    # Apply safety factor (use 25% of Kelly)
    kelly_fraction *= 0.25
    
    # Ensure bounds (max 20% per trade)
    kelly_fraction = max(0.0, min(kelly_fraction, 0.2))
    
    return position_size
```

**Benefits:**
- Optimal position sizing based on historical performance
- Safety factor prevents over-leveraging
- Bounded to prevent excessive risk

### 2. Dynamic Stop-Loss Management

```python
def calculate_dynamic_stop_loss(self, entry_price: float, current_price: float,
                             volatility: float, market_regime: str = "normal") -> float:
    base_stop_loss = 0.02  # 2% base
    
    # Adjust for volatility
    if volatility > 0.05:  # High volatility
        stop_loss = base_stop_loss * 1.5
    elif volatility < 0.02:  # Low volatility
        stop_loss = base_stop_loss * 0.8
    
    # Adjust for market regime
    regime_multipliers = {
        "bull": 1.2,      # Wider stops in bull market
        "bear": 0.8,      # Tighter stops in bear market
        "sideways": 1.0,  # Normal stops in sideways market
        "high_vol": 1.5,  # Much wider stops in high volatility
        "normal": 1.0
    }
    
    return stop_loss
```

**Benefits:**
- Adapts to market volatility
- Considers market regime
- Prevents premature exits in volatile markets

### 3. Circuit Breakers

```python
def should_halt_trading(self, risk_metrics: RiskMetrics) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    # Check daily loss limit
    if not self.check_daily_loss_limit(risk_metrics.current_drawdown):
        return True, "Daily loss limit exceeded"
    
    # Check drawdown limit
    if not self.check_drawdown_limit(risk_metrics.max_drawdown):
        return True, "Maximum drawdown exceeded"
    
    # Check position limit
    if not self.check_position_limit(len(self.active_positions)):
        return True, "Maximum positions exceeded"
    
    return False, ""
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents catastrophic losses
- Automatic trading halt when limits exceeded
- Multiple safety layers

### 4. Real-Time Risk Monitoring

```python
def update_risk_metrics(self, positions: List[PositionInfo], 
                       market_data: Dict[str, float]) -> RiskMetrics:
    # Calculate portfolio value
    portfolio_value = self.account_balance
    total_exposure = 0.0
    
    for position in positions:
        portfolio_value += position.unrealized_pnl
        total_exposure += abs(position.size * position.current_price)
    
    # Calculate risk metrics
    risk_metrics = RiskMetrics(
        portfolio_value=portfolio_value,
        total_exposure=total_exposure,
        max_drawdown=max_drawdown,
        current_drawdown=current_drawdown,
        volatility=volatility,
        sharpe_ratio=sharpe_ratio,
        var_95=var_95,
        var_99=var_99,
        correlation_risk=correlation_risk,
        concentration_risk=concentration_risk,
        leverage_risk=leverage_risk,
        liquidity_risk=liquidity_risk
    )
    
    return risk_metrics
```

**Benefits:**
- Continuous risk assessment
- Real-time portfolio monitoring
- Comprehensive risk metrics
