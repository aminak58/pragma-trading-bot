5. **Profit Taking**: ROI table optimized for bull market patterns

### **Why Strategies Fail in Bear Market**
1. **Trend Following**: Entry conditions fail in downtrends
2. **Momentum**: RSI and EMA conditions fail in bear markets
3. **Volume**: Volume patterns different in bear markets
4. **Risk Management**: Stop-losses hit frequently in bear markets
5. **Profit Taking**: ROI table fails in bear market patterns

### **Why Strategies Fail in Sideways Market**
1. **Trend Following**: Entry conditions fail in range-bound markets
2. **Momentum**: RSI and EMA conditions fail in sideways markets
3. **Volume**: Volume patterns different in sideways markets
4. **Risk Management**: Stop-losses hit frequently in sideways markets
5. **Profit Taking**: ROI table fails in sideways market patterns

- Identify historical market regimes
- Design regime classification system
- Prepare regime-specific testing

### **Phase 2 (Week 2)**
- Implement regime classification
- Create regime-specific testing protocol

## üö® **Critical Success Factors**

1. **Regime Agnostic**: Strategies work across all market regimes
2. **Historical Validation**: Test across 3-5 years of data
3. **Transition Robustness**: Strategies work during regime changes
4. **Volatility Robustness**: Strategies work across volatility levels
5. **Crisis Robustness**: Strategies work during market stress

## üìä **Conclusion**

Testing strategies only in a bull market is a critical flaw that makes them unreliable for live trading. Strategies must be tested across all market regimes to ensure robustness and reliability.
